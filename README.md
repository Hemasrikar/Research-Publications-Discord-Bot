## Features

- Add a channel in your server to receive the latest research papers using `/setchannel` command
- Supports multiple servers and channels
- Automatically posts the latest 3 papers every 6 hours
- Works with any research topic (keywords supported by arXiv)

**Drawback**: Need to run manually everytime to check for updates. To automate things, the program can be hosted
on some server. Currently working on it and making UI friendly.
